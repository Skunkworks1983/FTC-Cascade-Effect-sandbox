This folder contains *only* the code to be loaded onto the 2014 FTC Robot at compeittion time, *and nothing else*. Development should continue the 1983Game folder. 

Autonomous.c and TeleOp.c were copied from C:\Program Files\Robomatter Inc\ROBOTC Development Environment 4.X\Sample Programs\NXT\Templates.  On Sunday 11/16/14, the pragmas from 1983Game\teleop.c were copied into both TeleOp.c and Autonomous.c

To begin, you'll need to
1) Copy drivebase from 1983Game folder over to here.
2) Copy the contents of 1938Game\teleop'c's while loop into CompetitionCode\TelOp.C
